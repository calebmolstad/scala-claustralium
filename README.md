# *Scala Claustralium*

*Scala Claustralium* is a classic text of medieval spirituality. It lays out the practice of *lectio divina,* a method of reading and meditating on Christian scripture as well as a method of mystical ascent towards God. It was produced by Guigo II the ninth prior of the mother house of the Carthusian Order, Grande Chartreuse. The original was probably composed in the later half of the twelve century.

The aim of this project is to make the text of *Scala Claustralium* more accessible since a Latin version of the work is not easy to find. The text found here is from the [*Patrologiae Latina*](https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHYAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PT89#v=onepage&q&f=false) which is now in the public domain. Since OCR struggles to convert the *Patrologiae Latina* into plain text, I have transcribed it and will post pieces of it to the repository as I proofread my transcription.

Note: A second version, ascribed to Augustine, can be found in the [*Patrologiae Latina* here](https://books.google.com/books?id=qHHYAAAAMAAJ&pg=PT387#v=onepage&q&f=false). I have not transcribed that version.

## Transcription
I have made a few typographical changes in my transcription to update the *Patrologiae Latin*
- *j* > *i*
- *æ* & *œ* > *ae* & *oe*

A translation of the *Scala Claustralium* with an excellent introduction.

### Nota Bene
This project is intended to make the text more accessible; it should not be considered a "critical edition" or an academic work.
